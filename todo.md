# TODO
* Make tile system less stupid
* Make slide physics behave (continued)
* Work collision shapes into tile system
* Better testing of physics edge cases (pun intended)
* Keyboard input
* Sound integration?
* Multiple game planes
* Peek-through for lower planes
* 2.5D compatible tileset?
* runtime tile type loading???
* Test level
* Enemy logic/alerting system
* Make vectormath respect "wrong order" scalar mult
* Figure out why bouncing physics objects on 100% elasticity lose energy slowly

# BUGS
* Bouncing objects seem to lose a little energy even on 100% elasticity with every bounce
* Sometimes an object will hit a wall and just stop dead for no reason
